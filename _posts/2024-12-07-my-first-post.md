Hi, this is the first post of the blog. I'm planning to post regarding what I've been learning as a Cloud Engineer in my career. Most of the content will be related to AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, and Linux though there is still a possibility of other sorts of tech posts unrelated to the four things I mentioned.

I plan on doing this routinely as to boost my own portofolio and also as a way to refresh my knowledge as well. Hope I can keep myself motivated so I can post more of the stuffs as time goes in a consistent manner.
